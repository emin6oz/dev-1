Frequent exercises, including mind exercise, have been found to help stimulate new nerve cell connection and increase the chances of developing new brain cells. When this happens, your brain creates a cell reserve of some sort that protects against the loss of cells in the future. Some helpful mental stimulation activities you can try include puzzles, crosswords, and other mental games and activities that can help keep your mind sharp and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.</td>

That means not only treating injuries but also preventing them – especially in the new year, when many people resolve to start increasing their activities. The following list provides 20 quick tips for achieving and maintaining better orthopedic health in 2023.
                    Before you get to your main exercise routine, don’t forget to warm up. Warm-up exercises raise your body temperature, consequently prompting the release of synovial fluid and boosting blood flow to your muscles. This means less strain on your joints. Well-lubricated joints also enable you to execute sudden or explosive movements with ease while ensuring minimal risk for injury.</td>

                    Flossing is important to remove food particles that have been stuck between your teeth, where even the best toothbrush can’t reach.</td>

                  <td> Sunscreen is one of the single most important things you can do for your skin. When applied correctly, sunscreen protects your skin against the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, which cause sunburn, skin cancer, and premature skin aging, like wrinkles and age spots. For the best protection, apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and reapply every two hours or after swimming or sweating. To save time in your skin care routine, you can consider using a moisturizer that also contains sunscreen. However, while cosmetics that contain sunscreen are convenient, remember to reapply them in order to achieve the best sun protection. Keep in mind that since no sunscreen can block 100% of the sun’s UV rays, it’s also important to seek shade and wear sun-protective clothing when outdoors, including a ligthweight long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with UV protection, when possible. For more effective sun protection select clothing with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) label.</td>

In fact, you should make regular visits to your doc even when you don’t have a reason at all. “Wanting to be healthy is the only reason you need to see your OB/GYN,” Minkin encouraged. “It is absolutely necessary to schedule routine appointments to monitor your health as you age.” The general rule of thumb is an annual gynecological checkup, but talk to your doctor about what frequency makes sense for your body, symptoms, and lifestyle.</td>
